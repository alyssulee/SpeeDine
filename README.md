## What is SpeeDine?
SpeeDine is a web application that a restaurant can use to give its patrons an fast, efficient, and fun dining experience! Instead of using paper menus and having to order through a waiter, guests can use SpeeDine to have all the control in the palm on their hands! To access SpeeDine, guests can scan the QR code at their table. SpeeDine gives them the ability to look through the menu, order items, split the bill, request payment, call the waiter, and more!

What cases/functions were 
implemented? What data should be entered at which 
times? To ensure that we don't miss any of the best
